# Musical Timeline Widget Requirements

## Core Purpose
- Professional-grade timeline widget for displaying and editing musical events
- Similar to timelines found in Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs)
- Handle potentially very long sequences efficiently (beyond 65536 pixels)
- Musical time resolution: 960 ticks per quarter note

## RGB Bar System
### Data Structure
- Each bar belongs to a specific track
- Properties:
  - Start position (in ticks)
  - Length (in ticks)
  - RGB Color (no opacity/alpha channel)
  - Track assignment

### Visual Requirements
- Clear display of RGB bars within their tracks
- Proper alignment to musical grid
- Accurate color representation
- Visual feedback for selection state
- No overlap handling between bars

## Visual Requirements
### Timeline Header
- Display measure numbers
- Show time signatures
- Adjustable grid density based on zoom level
- Clear visual hierarchy of measure, beat, and subdivision lines

### Track System
- Multiple parallel tracks
- Track labels on the left side
- Consistent track heights with configurable spacing
- Clear visual separation between tracks

### Events
- Colored blocks representing musical events
- Variable length events
- Visual feedback for selection state
- Proper alignment to musical grid

## Technical Requirements
### Time Management
- Use musical time (ticks) as the primary coordinate system
- Support for multiple time signatures
- Precise conversion between screen coordinates and musical time
- Standard MIDI resolution (960 ticks per quarter note)

### Performance
- Efficient rendering of only visible content
- Smooth scrolling of long sequences
- No flickering during updates
- Proper double buffering
- Handle large timelines without performance degradation

### Zoom System
- Multiple zoom levels for different editing granularity
- Maintain position context while zooming
- Zoom centered on mouse position
- Smooth zoom transitions

### Scrolling System
- Horizontal scrolling for timeline navigation
- Custom scrollbar for large virtual widths
- Smooth scrolling behavior
- Proper handling of very long sequences

## User Interaction Requirements
### Navigation
- Mouse wheel scrolling (with Shift key for horizontal)
- Zoom with Ctrl+Mouse wheel
- Click and drag scrolling
- Keyboard navigation support

### Event Manipulation (planned)
- Click to select events
- Drag to move events
- Resize events
- Multi-select capabilities
- Snap to grid

## Visual Style Requirements
### Professional Appearance
- Clean, modern look
- Clear visual hierarchy
- High-quality text rendering
- Smooth graphics
- Proper use of colors and contrast

### Visual Feedback
- Clear selection states
- Grid visibility appropriate to zoom level
- Clear measure markings
- Distinct track separation

## Technical Constraints
### Memory Usage
- Efficient use of GDI+ resources
- Proper resource cleanup
- Minimal object creation during rendering

### Coordinate Systems
- Handle conversion between:
  - Musical time (ticks)
  - Screen coordinates (pixels)
  - Virtual coordinates (for scrolling)
- Maintain precision at all zoom levels

### Extensibility
- Clean separation of concerns
- Modular design for future features
- Easy to add new visual elements
- Configurable visual properties

This widget should be professional-grade, similar to what you'd find in commercial DAW software, with smooth performance and a polished user experience.
