### MIDILightDrawer
A simple GUI tool to draw light events based on Guitar Pro 5 tablatures. The drawn events can be exported as MIDI files and played back by common DAWs. The MIDI information is interpreted as light information (reg, green and blue) by custom made LED strip controllers (see repoitory https://github.com/MrChros/MIDI_Lighter). 

This is a private project and it has no commerical use. Feel free te reuse any of the code again or contact me in case of questions.

But shoutout to https://github.com/PhilPotter/gp_parser for the GP5 parser. I fixed some issues, but it is alreay very good!
