Combined Event and Tablature Display for Timeline Widget
Overview
Extend the existing timeline widget to show both MIDI events (colored bars) and guitar tablature simultaneously for each track.
Visual Layout
Track Structure

Each track is divided into two sections:

Upper section: Event display (colored bars)
Lower section: Tablature display


Sections separated by a thin dividing line
Both sections scroll horizontally in sync

Constants and Measurements

Default tab display height: 100 pixels
Tab line spacing: 12 pixels
6 lines for standard guitar tuning
Track height = Base event height + Tab display height
